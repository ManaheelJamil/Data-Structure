Algorithm
algorithm is like steps, to write program and logic

Big-O-Notation
we denote complexity in code by BIG-O-Notation


We have nultiple complexity
Time complexity (like which time taken to run program it''s called complexity of time)
Space complexity (like how many space of code  it's called complexity of speed)


NO OF LINE OF CODE -------> Time complexity
SPACE WHICH WE USE FOR WRITE CODE LIKE VARIABLE -------> Space complexity
